# ESP32 Telegram Bot for Temperature and Luminosity Monitoring

This repository contains the code for an ESP32-based Telegram bot that provides information about temperature and luminosity readings. The bot utilizes the DS18B20 temperature sensor and the Max44009 light sensor to gather the required data.

# Features
- Retrieves temperature and luminosity readings from DS18B20 and Max44009 sensors, respectively.
- Sends the collected data to a Telegram bot for remote monitoring.

# Prerequisites
To use this code, you will need the following:

- An ESP32 development board.
- DS18B20 temperature sensor.
- Max44009 light sensor.
- Arduino IDE with ESP32 support installed.
- Telegram bot token and credentials (Can be obtained from BotFather).

# Acknowledgments
This project was inspired by the need for remote monitoring of temperature and luminosity using an ESP32 board and Telegram bots. Special thanks to the developers of the libraries used in this project for their contributions.

If you have any questions or encounter any issues, please feel free to open an issue in this repository.
